      <h1>It beat the world </h1>
      <p>October 11th, 2018 

<br>Back when I was 10, I learned how to play the game of GO, an ancient chess game, for the first time.As a child, I had the curiosity to explore almost anything unknown to me, and the game of GO became the biggest playground for me to explore.Nonetheless,I remember being taught to always start the game from serval specific point on the board, which I don’t understand quite well, in a result, everyone follows that same pattern in their first ten moves, no surprises.The game became dry sometimes.But the variability of this game has always mesmerized  me; I never had a clear understanding of why should we make certain moves, but from that time I began to admire human ingenuity in a whole new way, for that we have mastered a game as complicated as GO.Despite that, I have never thought that a machine could have the intelligence to beat human in this chess game.<br> 

<br>In October 2015, Deep Dream at Google designed a computer program called AlphaGo who defeated the European Go champion Fan Hui, a 2-dan (out of 9 dan possible) professional, five to zero. This was the first time a computer Go program had beaten a professional human player on a full-sized board without handicap.In the following year, alphaGo beat South Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol, ranked 9-dan, one of the best players at Go, three to one. <br>

<br>This is when alphaGo shocked the world as it went on to defeat the world No.1 ranked player,Ke Ji. Throughout three years of span, alphaGo gained far more improvement than any human can imagine.Ke Ji didn’t get a single victory against this invisible foe, even if he was the best player in the world at the time. <br>

<br>However, that’s not the end for Alpha Go. In 2017, the decedent of alphaGo, alpha Zero, beat its predecessor by sixty to zero, leaving human players far behind. <br>

<br>I was shocked and in silence when I witness the lifeless machine beat us at what we are good at.It proved me wrong.Maybe the scope at which we have understood is only a tiny fraction of the Game itself, just like a sand in the universe.Like many people, I felt sad for how little we truly know about things.After the game with Alpha Go, in the interview, with tears in his eyes Ke Ji said:” It is so great, I had no chance of beating it; I realize I know so little about this game now, Alpha Go is too great.” I believe this is the one most monumental moment in human history.The age of Artificial Intelligence has set up at dawn. </p>
